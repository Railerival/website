But there are other methods like static methods and class methods which will be learned later. if you dont use self in the fullname that is <code>def fullname():</code> it will give a TypeError <pre><code>Exception has occurred: TypeError\nEmployee.fullname() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given\n  File \"C:\\Users\\hp\\Desktop\\White room\\Python\\python essentials\\coding-journal-2025\\oop\\test.py\", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;\n    print(emp_1.fullname())\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nTypeError: Employee.fullname() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given\n</code></pre> You can also do <code>Employee.fullname(emp)</code> instead of <code>emp_1.fullname()</code> and the difference is method is getting called on the class and the instance has to be explicitly passed whereas <code>emp_1.fullname()</code> the method is directly being used on the instance</p>"},{"location":"oop/#class-variables","title":"Class variables","text":"<p>Variables that are shared among all the instances of the class. <pre><code>class Employee:\n    def __init__(self,fname,lname,pay):\n        self.fname = fname\n        self.lname = lname\n        self.pay = pay\n        self.email = fname + lname + \"@gmail.com\"\n    def applyraise(self\n        self.pay = self.pay*1.04\nemp_1 = Employee(\"corey\",\"schafer\",5000)\nemp_2 = Employee(\"Rai\",\"Rai\",6000)\nprint(emp_1.pay)\nemp_1.applyraise()\nprint(emp_1.pay)\n</code></pre> This works but a better way would be: <pre><code>class Employee:\n    raise = 1.04\n    def __init__(self,fname,lname,pay):\n        self.fname = fname\n        self.lname = lname\n        self.pay = pay\n        self.email = fname + lname + \"@gmail.com\"\n    def applyraise(self)\n        self.pay = self.pay*self.raise\nemp_1 = Employee(\"corey\",\"schafer\",5000)\nemp_2 = Employee(\"Rai\",\"Rai\",6000)\nprint(emp_1.pay)\nemp_1.applyraise()\nprint(emp_1.pay)\nprint(Employee.raise)\nprint(emp_1.raise)\nprint(emp_2.raise)\nprint(emp_1.__dict__)\nprint(Employee.__dict__)\n</code></pre> Here there is a class variable which is an attribute of the class and is also a common attribute to all the instances <code>self.pay = self.pay*self.raise</code> this needed a <code>self.raise</code> rather than a <code>raise</code> because otherwise it would not be  accessible another way to acces it would be <code>self.pay = self.pay*Employee.raise</code>. <pre><code>print(Employee.raise)\nprint(emp_1.raise)\nprint(emp_2.raise)\n</code></pre> This tells how the class variable can be accessed outside the class and shows that it is common to all instances and the class itself. <pre><code>print(emp_1.__dict__)\nprint(Employee.__dict__)\n</code></pre> This prints the namespace of the instance and the class and shows that the class one displays the class variable but the instance one does not have it.But when we do the <code>print(emp_1.raise)</code> the instance accesses it from the  class <pre><code>class Employee:\n    raise = 1.04\n    def __init__(self,fname,lname,pay):\n        self.fname = fname\n        self.lname = lname\n        self.pay = pay\n        self.email = fname + lname + \"@gmail.com\"\nemp_1 = Employee(\"corey\",\"schafer\",5000)\nemp_2 = Employee(\"Rai\",\"Rai\",6000)\nEmployee.raise = 1.05\nprint(Employee.raise)\nprint(emp_1.raise)\nprint(emp_2.raise)\n</code></pre> <code>Employee.raise = 1.05</code> changed the class variable for everything including the instances and the class <pre><code>class Employee:\n    raise = 1.04\n    def __init__(self,fname,lname,pay):\n        self.fname = fname\n        self.lname = lname\n        self.pay = pay\n        self.email = fname + lname + \"@gmail.com\"\nemp_1 = Employee(\"corey\",\"schafer\",5000)\nemp_2 = Employee(\"Rai\",\"Rai\",6000)\nemp_1.raise = 1.05\nprint(Employee.raise)\nprint(emp_1.raise)\nprint(emp_2.raise)\nprint(emp_1.__dict__)\n</code></pre> <code>emp_1.raise = 1.05</code> gives a variable attribute to only emp_1 instance and its also seen its namespace.</p> <p><pre><code>class Employee:\n    noofemployees = 0\n    def __init__(self,fname,lname,pay):\n        self.fname = fname\n        self.lname = lname\n        self.pay = pay\n        self.email = fname + lname + \"@gmail.com\"\n        noofemployees += 1\nemp_1 = Employee(\"corey\",\"schafer\",5000)\nemp_2 = Employee(\"Rai\",\"Rai\",6000)\nprint(noofemployees)\n</code></pre> This gives an output 2 because the variable gets incremented 2 times because 2 instances were instantiated and would get stored in the memory as a class variable</p>"}]}
